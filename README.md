## State Machines with xState

This is a source code of my talk about the use of xState to get control of a UI


### Get Started
```
yarn install;
yarn start;
```

### State Machines

In the src/machines folder is possible to see a machine representing a flow that shows and hides a loading depending on the return status of an HTTP request.

To see the machine in action install the [xState Chrome extension](https://github.com/amitnovick/xstate-devtools)
